### This app was created with expo init as a base. This is here to demonstate components using new hooks (also works for react.js)

## Getting Started
- if you do not have node.js you can download the latest here [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- clone my repo locally
- once you have node.js successfully installed you can run the command ```npm install expo-cli --global```
